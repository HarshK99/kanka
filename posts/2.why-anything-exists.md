excerpt: "Most products exist to prevent human collapse. This post shares a framework to analyze companies from first principles."

Most products look different on the surface, but at the root they all exist to prevent some form of human collapse.  
If you strip away branding, tech, and business models, what remains are a few **survival needs** and a few **ways humans act to protect them**.

This post shares a simple framework to analyze **verbs, industries, and companies** from first principles.

## The core idea

All human activity serves **four survival layers**:

- Body survival  
- Mind survival  
- Social survival  
- Species survival  

And all survival is executed through **six core action modes**:

- Take in energy  
- Recover capacity  
- Protect and secure  
- Regulate stability  
- Choose and align  
- Bond and continue  

Everything else is a wrapper.

## Matrix 1. Survival × actions (verbs)

This img shows **what humans actually do** to protect each survival layer.

These are irreducible behaviors.  
If something does not fit here, it is probably not fundamental.

## Matrix 2. Survival × industries

Industries are just **scaled solutions** to the same survival problems.

Some industries feel optional only because their survival role is indirect.  
Remove them long enough and collapse shows up elsewhere.

## Matrix 3. Survival × top global companies

Companies are simply the **best current implementations** inside each cell.

The company is replaceable.  
The **cell is not**.

## Why this framework is useful

- It explains why very different businesses coexist  
- It shows why “boring” industries never die  
- It helps evaluate ideas, careers, and companies by depth  

A simple test:

If this disappears, does it cause inconvenience or fear?

Fear usually means it touches a deep survival layer.

## Final thought

Most analysis starts with products.  
This framework starts with **humans**.

Once you see businesses as survival infrastructure, a lot of things suddenly make sense.
