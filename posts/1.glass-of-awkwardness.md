## The glass of awkwardness

Have you noticed how social discomfort grows the longer you wait to speak? I call this the glass of awkwardness. It starts thin, almost invisible, but it thickens rapidly with time.

## Why awkwardness grows exponentially

When you first meet someone, the moment is neutral. No expectations, no judgments. As seconds pass without interaction, your mind fills the gap.

• Are they expecting me to say something  
• Am I interrupting  
• What if I sound foolish  

Each unanswered question adds another layer of glass, making a simple hello feel disproportionately hard.

## The golden moment

The best time to talk is immediately, usually within the first 5–10 seconds. Context is fresh, stakes are low, and momentum exists. Once that window closes, starting feels harder for no good reason.

## How to break the glass fast

• Use a simple opener tied to the situation  
• Ask about them, not yourself  
• Accept slight awkwardness as normal  

The core idea is simple. The glass only thickens if you let it. Break it early, and most social interactions become easy instead of intimidating.
